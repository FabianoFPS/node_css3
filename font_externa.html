            The @font-face CSS at-rule specifies a custom font with which to display text; the font can be loaded from either a remote server or a locally-installed font on the user's own computer. If the local() function is provided, specifying a font name to look for on the user's computer, and the user agent finds a match, that local font is used. Otherwise, the font resource specified using the url() function is downloaded and used.

By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face makes it possible to design content without being limited to the so-called "web-safe" fonts (that is, the fonts which are so common that they're considered to be universally available). The ability to specify the name of a locally-installed font to look for and use makes it possible to customize the font beyond the basics while making it possible to do so without relying on an Internet connection.

It's common to use both url() and local() together, so that the user's installed copy of the font is used if available, falling back to downloading a copy of the font if it's not found on the user's device.

The @font-face at-rule may be used not only at the top level of a CSS, but also inside any CSS conditional-group at-rule.
